# Simple Merge Sorting Algorithm Visualization

Program that makes a visualization of the Merge Sort Algorithm with pygame.




## What is Merge Sorting?
**Merge Sort** is a classic divide-and-conquer algorithm used for sorting an array or list. It works by recursively dividing the array into smaller sub-arrays, sorting each of those sub-arrays, and then merging them back together to form the final sorted array.
